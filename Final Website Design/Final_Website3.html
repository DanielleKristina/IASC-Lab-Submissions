  <h1> Helpful Tips for Taking Care of your Rescue <h1>

	<p> At Small Paws Dog Rescue, we know the adoption process can be a difficult and sometimes stressful time for our pups. Some of them have spent years in our care or are new to the facility but did not have the best quality of life with previous owners. We've prepared some tips that will make the adoption process smoother for both owners and their fur babies. </p>

  <ol>
    <li> Prepare </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Put away any dangerous clutter or anything that can get destroyed </li>
				<li> Make sure you have everything you need to take care of your new friend (i.e., leash, collar, id tag, food, bowls, poop bags, a crate or bed, as well as grooming supplies)
				<li> If your dog is young, maybe do some research on some dog training programs </li>
				<li> Lot of toys! </li>
			</ul>
    <li> Establish household rules and routines </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Establish a potty schedule as well as times for walks and feeding </li>
				<li> Use treats as positive reinforcement for obeyed orders and good behaviour </li>
      </ul>
    <li> Be patient </li>
      <ul>
        <li> A lot of our pups have sad backstories, but the good news is that they have you to take care of them now. Allow a grace period of about 3 weeks for your new friend to get used to their environment </li>
      </ul>
		<li> Get insight from behavioural experts </li>
			<ul>
				<li> If you are having ongoing troubles, or would simply like to prepare for your new dog's arrival, it is wise to seek guidance from our dog behavioural experts on hand </li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
