		<h3> About Us </h3>

			<p> Small Paws Dog Rescue was established in 2015 by Jenny and Mark Burgos. The two had been a part of a foster program for a local shelter nearby but as time passed, they realized that they couldn't help every single rescue they came across within their house anymore. Especially because so many people were starting to adopt from breeders </p>
			<p> After approved rights for the construction of the shelter, Jenny and Mark made it their mission to change people's outlook on stray dogs and reshape their lives one small paw at a time </p>
